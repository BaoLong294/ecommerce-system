# Uniqlo-inspired E-commerce System

## Introduction

This project is a full-fledged e-commerce system developed as part of my Fullstack self-learning journey with The Odin Project. The system comprises a consumer-facing e-commerce website and an internal administration dashboard for managing inventory (IMS) and orders (OMS). The primary goal is to simulate the shopping and management experience of a large e-commerce platform, drawing inspiration from Uniqlo.com.

## Initial Project Goals

- **Build a complete Fullstack system**: Encompassing Frontend (React), Backend (Node.js/Express), and Database (PostgreSQL).
- **Develop two distinct web applications**:
  - **E-commerce Storefront**: Allows users to browse products, add to cart, place orders, and track order status.
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Enables administrators to manage products (IMS) and orders (OMS), including basic delivery management.
- **Apply knowledge from The Odin Project**: From foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to advanced concepts of React, Node.js, Databases, and APIs.
- **Design a user interface inspired by Uniqlo**: Focusing on minimalism, modernity, and a user-friendly experience.
- **Learn effective project management with Git/GitHub**: Practicing professional Git operations, writing clear commit messages, and maintaining a clean version history.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend (E-commerce Website & Admin Dashboard):**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (specifically Flexbox & Grid, Responsive Design)
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - React (with React Router, Hooks, Context API/Zustand)
  - (Optional: UI/CSS Framework like Tailwind CSS)
  - (Basic Map API for order tracking display)
- **Backend (API):**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Authentication
  - Bcrypt for Password Hashing
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL
  - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping, e.g., Prisma)
- **Tools & Environment:**
  - Git & GitHub (Version Control)
  - VS Code (Development Environment)
  - npm / Yarn (Package Management)

## Implemented Features (Update this section upon completing each stage)

- **E-commerce Storefront:**

  - [Feature 1: E.g., Browse and filter products by category.]
  - [Feature 2: E.g., View detailed product information.]
  - [Feature 3: E.g., Add products to a shopping cart and manage quantities.]
  - [Feature 4: E.g., User registration, login, and account management.]
  - [Feature 5: E.g., Basic order placement and checkout process.]
  - [Feature 6: E.g., View past order history.]
  - [Feature 7: E.g., Order status tracking (text-based and simple static map display).]
  - [Add more features as they are completed.]

- **Admin Dashboard (IMS & OMS):**
  - [Feature 1: E.g., Admin login and authorization.]
  - [Feature 2: E.g., Product management (add, edit, delete, update stock levels).]
  - [Feature 3: E.g., View and manage all orders (approve, change status).]
  - [Feature 4: E.g., Basic delivery management (assigning orders to shippers, updating order status from admin side).]
  - [Add more features as they are completed.]

## Skills Demonstrated (Update this section upon project completion)

- **Fullstack Development**: Designed and built a comprehensive application from frontend to backend and database.
- **Frontend Development (React)**: Constructed dynamic, component-based user interfaces, managed state, and handled API interactions.
- **Backend Development (Node.js/Express)**: Built RESTful APIs, handled business logic, authentication, and authorization.
- **Database Design and Management (PostgreSQL)**: Designed schemas, performed CRUD operations, and utilized an ORM.
- **System Architecture**: Built multiple frontend applications interacting with a shared backend and database.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application functions well across various devices.
- **Version Control**: Leveraged Git and GitHub for collaborative workflow (even as an individual) and effective code management.
- **Problem-Solving & Debugging**: Overcame technical challenges throughout the development process.
- [Add more skills learned or reinforced, e.g., Map API Integration, Error Handling, Clean Code.]

## Lessons Learned (Update this section upon project completion)

- **Biggest Challenge**: [Describe a specific challenge you faced, e.g., "Designing a complex database schema to support multiple user roles (customer, admin, shipper) and intricate product-order-inventory relationships was an initial hurdle."]
- **How it was Overcome**: [Describe how you resolved that challenge, e.g., "I dedicated time to researching common e-commerce schema patterns, utilized an ERD design tool, and iterated on the design based on evolving functional requirements."]
- **What I Would Do Differently**: [Mention areas you would improve or change if you were to restart the project, e.g., "Next time, I would prioritize implementing automated tests (unit/integration tests) for both frontend and backend earlier in the development cycle to ensure higher code quality from the start."]
- **Overall Lesson**: [Conclude with a general lesson learned from this project, e.g., "This project reinforced my understanding of the importance of detailed architectural planning before coding, and how fullstack components interact within a real-world system."]
